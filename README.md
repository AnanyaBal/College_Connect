# CollegeConnect
This was a website to connect different groups of people associated with colleges to other groups through authorized channels. There are provisions for students and prospective students to ask questions about colleges (through adding tags) which can only be answered by the authorized employees of the college (admins). There is a provision for polling and posting notices for events such as fests and competitions.
